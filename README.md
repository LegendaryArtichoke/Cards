# Cards

Implements some useful functions and elements to use a deck of cards in your favorite C projects!

# Some basic infos about the types

Given a ```Card new_card``` variable, you can access and assign its suit and face value with ```Suit suit = new_card.suit``` and ```Value value = new_card.value```. The following suits and values are supported:

_SUITS:_
- HEARTS
- DIAMONDS
- SPADES
- CLUBS
- JOKER
- SHUFFLE_MARKER

_VALUES:_
- ACE
- TWO
- THREE
- FOUR
- FIVE
- SIX
- SEVEN
- EIGHT
- NINE
- TEN
- JACK
- QUEEN
- KING
- JOKER_VALUE
- SHUFFLE_MARKER_VALUE

You can get the string literal associated with a card's suit or value with ```char *new_suit = suit(new_card)```and ```char *new_value = value(new_card)``` please note that you **can't** get the suit literal or value literal of a shuffle marker.

Given a ```Deck *new_deck``` variable you can access the number of its cards (drawn + NOT drawn, jokers and shuffle markers not included) with ```new_deck->cards_nmb```, the number of jokers (drawn + NOT drawn) with ```new_deck->jokers``` and the number of shuffle markers (drawn + NOT drawn) with ```new_deck->shuffle_markers```.

# Brief tutorial

**_To create a new deck:_**

```c
Deck *new_deck = deck_create(NUMBER_OF_DECKS, NUMBER_OF_JOKERS, NUMBER_OF_SHUFFLE_MARKERS, TOGGLE_AUTOSHUFFLE);
```
_NUMBER_OF_DECKS_ indicates the number of decks the new deck will be made out of. For example, keeping in mind that a standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards (13 per suit), if NUMBER_OF_DECKS = 3 the new_deck will be made out of 3 * 52 cards, with 3 copies of each card.

_NUMBER_OF_JOKERS_ indicates the number of jokers present in the deck.

_NUMBER_OF_SHUFFLE_MARKERS_ specifies how many shuffle markers are there in the deck.

_TOGGLE_AUTOSHUFFLE_ toggles the autoshuffle feature of the draw function on or off. 1 = ON, 0 = OFF.

**_To draw a card:_**

```c
Card drawn_card = deck_draw(new_deck);
```

Where deck is the deck from which you want your card to be drawn from.

_The decks get shuffled automatically once all cards have been drawn from it, unless specified otherwise during the deck creation process_

**_To shuffle a deck_**

```c
deck_shuffle(new_deck);
```

Keep in mind that shuffling here means taking all the dealt cards and shuffling them back into the deck.

**_To remove a card from a deck_**

```c
(void)card_remove(card, new_deck);
```

remove_card returns 1 if the operation was successful, otherwise it returns 0.

**_To check if a card is a figure_**

```c
int figure = is_figure(new_card);
```

is_figure returns 1 if the card is a figure, otherwise it returns 0.

**_To check the number of cards yet to be drawn_**

```c
int not_drawn = cards_available(new_deck);
```

**_To remove a deck that no longer needs to be used_**

```c
deck_free(new_deck);
```

Be careful not to use the removed deck in future function calls!

**_Error log file_**

In case any error occurs, an error message will be printed out on an error log file. The log file will be saved by default in the current working directory, but you can change this by modifying the `const char error_log[] = " "` variable right at the beginning of `cards.c` to whichever directory you like. Simply insert the target directory inside the `" "`.

# Sample program

I've made a blackjack sample program that I coded using this library... have fun using it and exploring the way I implement cards.c library functions! The game is played with 8 decks and the 3 available commands are HIT, STAND and EXIT.

# In conclusion

I hope you find this library useful, I had lots of fun writing this! I recommend you check the _cards.h_ header to discover more functions that you may find useful and the _cards.c_ file to have a more in depth understanding of how everything works. I tried to make each function as efficient as possible, minimizing wasted time and CPU use while giving you the same odds of drawing a card that you would normally get if you drew a card with a real deck of cards.  I am open to suggestions on new functions to implement or on how to make things more efficient... _enjoy!_
